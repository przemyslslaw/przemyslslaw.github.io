<!-- My research contributes statistical methods to understand and augment social intelligence in the systems of our information society. The ambition of my research is to develop a mathematical understanding of fundamental social processes and to design **fair and efficient social** computing systems. -->

My research contributes statistical methods to **understand** and **augment** public opinion formation within our digital information society's systems. My endeavors are geared towards ensuring that tomorrow's AI and social media are representative, fair, explainable, and ready to interact with our open world for public good.
* To deepen our **understanding** of public opinion, I innovate statistical methods for extracting representative signals about the public from social media and news media. 
* To **augment** public opinion formation, I pioneer representative social media designs facilitating political discourse and machine learning methods [adhering to legal provisions](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/equate-ml/2023/12/13/fair-machine-learning-post-affirmative-action/), e.g., by [preventing discrimination](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/equate-ml/2022/04/07/how-to-train-models-that-do-not-propagate-discrimination/), while [providing AI explanations](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/equate-ml/2023/07/25/towards-an-ai-accountability-policy/). 


Research areas: *fair and explainable machine learning, data science, computational social science, social media, network science, causality, open-world learning*.

* Our [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.12925) "Election Polls on Social Media: Prevalence, Biases, and Voter Fraud Beliefs" received Best Paper Honorable Mention üèÜ at ICWSM'25! Congratulations to our team!
![image](/images/zdf.png){: .align-right width="25%"}
* Our study "Political Biases on X before the 2025 German Federal Election" has been broadcast by ZDF (German public TV channel). I attach our Uncommon Good [blog post](https://open.substack.com/pub/uncommongood/p/political-biases-on-x-before-the?r=252a0b&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) and [full research report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14880275).

![image](/images/science.png){: .align-right width="30%"}
* Science published our [eLetter](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13787981), along with an [editorial](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.adt2983) and [article](https://www.science.org/content/article/study-found-facebook-algorithm-didnt-promote-political-polarization-critics-doubt ) discussing its implications. In it, we call into question a widely reported [Science paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp9364), funded by Meta, which suggested that Facebook's news feed algorithm is effective at preventing misinformation.

![image](/images/elpais.png){: .align-right width="30%"}
* Our research on election polls on social media has been [covered by various media outlets](https://socialpolls.org/#/media), including [Tech Policy Press](https://www.techpolicy.press/x-polls-skew-political-realities-of-us-presidential-elections/), El Pa√≠s, Fox network, and Phys.org!
* Our three submissions to the International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2) have been accepted as talks! (Topics: social polls, global news coverage, and scientific promotion.)
* Out of our four submissions to ICWSM'24 (including JQD:DM), two manuscripts -- about social media polls and news articles -- were accepted, and two other ones received "Revise and Resubmit" decisions, which typically end in acceptance as well. Congratulations SIMS lab!!!
* I've been quoted in the BusinessWest [article](https://businesswest.com/blog/ai-promises-to-impact-the-workforce-in-unexpected-ways/) "AI Promises To Impact The Workforce In Unexpected Ways"

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
