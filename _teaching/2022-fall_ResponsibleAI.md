The real-world deployment of machine learning models faces a series of lateral challenges affecting model trustworthiness, such as domain generalization, dataset shifts, causal validity, explainability, fairness, representativeness, and transparency. These challenges become increasingly important in techno-social systems affecting human high-stake decision making, which is often regulated by law. In this course, students will learn techniques for robust model evaluation, model selection, causal discovery, explainable and fair artificial intelligence, and interpretable models. In addition, students will reason about representativeness, transparency, and legal aspects of techno-social systems. The course will review both cutting-edge research and relevant portions of recent open-access textbooks. Coursework includes reading recent research papers, programming assignments, and a final group project. After completing the course, students should be able to develop, investigate, evaluate, and deploy artificial intelligence systems more responsibly.

## Learning Objectives
Through this course students will:
* become familiar with outstanding challenges in artificial intelligence and techno-social systems,
* gain an understanding of various ways in which machine learning can be evaluated,
* practice the usage of tools explaining black-box models,
* learn to develop models meeting various fairness criteria,
* learn to develop interpretable machine learning models,
* learn to reason about trustworthiness of techno-social systems.

## Textbooks
The course does not have a required textbook, but we will follow selected chapters from multiple textbooks. All readings for this course are available online.

## Policies
### Accommodation Statement
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all students.  If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course.  If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may make appropriate arrangements.  For further information, please visit Disability Services ([https://www.umass.edu/disability/](https://www.umass.edu/disability/))

### Academic Honesty Statement
Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University.  Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty.  Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty.  Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct.  Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible.  Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair.  Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent ([http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/](https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/)).

### Inclusion Policy
In this course, each voice has something of value to contribute. Please take care to respect the different experiences, beliefs, and values expressed by students and staff involved in this course. We support UMass Amherst’s commitment to diversity, and welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, citizenships, disability, sex, education, ethnicities, family statuses, genders, gender identities, geographical locations, languages, military experience, political views, races, religions, sexual orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and work experiences.

*The instructor reserves the right to modify this syllabus to account for current events and to better support student learning.*
